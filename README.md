#Bug Stampede!

##Setting Up Bug Stampede

Begin by navigating [here](https://github.com/ptkresch/froggerclone) to find the Github repository for the game. Select the 'Clone or download' button and choose one of the options: Open in Github desktop, Download ZIP file, or copy the git url to the clipboard. The latter utilizes Github through the terminal or command line. 

If the ZIP file is download, simply extract the folder using an unarchiver program and browse the folder for a file named 'index.html'. Open this file using a web browser (Chrome recommended) and the game will start.

If using Github through the terminal, navigate to the folder you would like to clone the repository to. Then enter the following: 

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

The above url is the one copied to the clipboard from the main repository page, so simply paste the url after typing 'git clone'. Following this, a local repository should be created with all the files necessary to run the game. Navigate to the folder and open 'index.html' inside of it with a web browser (again, Chrome recommended). 

##Game Instructions 

The page will load with a start button and an instructions button. Hit the instructions button for some information regarding the game. Detailed instructions will be listed here.
